This is my own personal blog. I figured people might want to copy some of the layout or structure, so feel free to do so.

The blog is hosted via Amazon S3 and CloudFront at [http://blog.rzimmerman.me](http://blog.rzimmerman.me).

I use [journo](https://github.com/jashkenas/journo) to generate the HTML files.
